# docker-telegram-cli
Docker for the Telegram-CLI, which will run the setup, if incomplete, and ```$COMMAND``` afterwards.   

I forgot if this works or not. 
*If* I remember right this docker just installs the cli.
You need to connect to the commandline inside and enter the phone number and code the first time.
